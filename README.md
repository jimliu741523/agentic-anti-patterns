# agentic-anti-patterns

> **The anti-awesome-list.** A curated catalog of how AI agents fail in production — with symptoms, root causes, and concrete mitigations.

Every week a new `awesome-ai-agents` list ships. Meanwhile teams shipping real agents keep rediscovering the same painful failure modes. This repo inverts the format: instead of cataloguing what's cool, it catalogues what **breaks** — in enough detail that you can recognize, prevent, and diagnose each failure in your own system.

**Scope.** Failure modes observable in deployed LLM-agent systems (tool-using agents, coding agents, research agents, agentic loops). Pure RAG or chat isn't the focus unless a concrete agentic failure mode appears.

**Non-goals.** Model-choice holy wars. Benchmark leaderboards. Hypothetical failures nobody has actually seen.

**This is not a skills catalog.** A "skills" or "patterns" repo (`openai/skills`, `vercel-labs/skills`, `awesome-codex-skills`, the `awesome-agentic-patterns` family) tells you *what an agent can do well* — recipes for the happy path. This catalog assumes you already have those, and asks the inverse question: *what breaks?* The two complement each other; neither subsumes the other. If you're picking up an agent stack for the first time, go read a skills catalog first; come back here when you start running one in production and need to recognize the smoke before the fire.
